Target goals 
      Analyze toxic releases with Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) data, Visualize changes, improvements or lack of improvements within
      different regions as well as industry sectors. Compare the benefits and disadvantages of industrial production facilities. Use
      Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) data to find trends in these data that reveal the impact that industrial production has on
      communities and home values. (If possible)

Assigned task- NC TRI data analysis years 2002-2006

Achieved goals/ activities
1. Plotting on-site releases, Top releasing facilities vs top carcinogen releasing facilities, Total/top carcinogen releases by industry sector
FloridaTRIexperimenting.ipynb (October 11-October 15) Learning features of data frames with the dataset
NCTRI2001-2005.ipynb (October 15-October 18) analyzing Top releasing facilities vs top carcinogen releasing facilities, Total/top carcinogen releases by industry sector
NCTRI2002-2006(updated years).ipynb (October 18) Update year ranges to 2001-2005 notebook
Map beginning.ipynb (October 18) Plotting on-site releases, specifically facilities with carcinogen releases
Map beginning(updated).ipynb (October 18-October 20 Plotting on-site releases, specifically facilities with carcinogen releases

2. FloridaTRIexperimenting notebook (Estimate 6-7 hours) Est 2-3 hours for following notebooks

Target goals 
      Overall project goal is to explore TRI data and relations therein, and find ways to connect
      overall toxic release in areas with home value fluctuations from Zillow data.

Achieved goals/ activities
  - Created group presentation(3-4 hrs)
  - Initial analysis for Michigan to test pandas functions(1-2 hrs)
  - Graphing and plotting for top release data totals and carcinogen totals in year range(3-4 hrs)
  - Tested Zillow website API to try and find a way to combine neighborhood location data with
    latitude and longitude data given in ZHVI data sets(2-3 hrs). Nothing found that seemed useful. Swetha
    is looking into potential using centroid data from shape files, so hopefully that will allow
    us to implement some combination of the sets!
  - Created command line utility to clean TRI State and US CSV files(5-6 hrs, planning, coding, and testing)
    - Trims out all irrelevant columns for our project
    - Renames some columns to achieve standard naming for column usage
    - Handles NaN values in numerical columns
    - Creates local folders for State and US and exports cleaned CSV
    - Significantly reduces CSV file size(~75% reduction)
    - Created Jupyter Notebook building the utility step-by-step, with examples
    - Updated after initial creation to include State CSV conversion
      - State CSV files are handled with the same process
      - Script dynamically assigns the appropriate sub-folder and new CSV name
  - Created script to load often used files and some helper variables/functions(3-4 hrs)
    - pre-made lists of state names and abbreviations
    - function to create dictionary object and pair with list of data values
    - function to take dict object with state/value and map with Basemap
    - Created Jupyter Notebook explaining script contents and purpose, with examples of use
  - Distilled and generalized Class Assignment 4 analysis for group project(3-4 hrs)
    - noticed trend in single industry sector of massive outlier contribution
    - wrote functions to explore outlier stats for given year range and industry sector
    - wrote functions to summarize and plot general stats for intustry sector for 30-year period

Swetha Polisetty

Assigned task- NC TRI data analysis years 2007-2011

Achieved goals/ activities
  - Provided guidelines and key points for initial group presentation
  - Initial analysis for NC TRI data using pandas (1-2 hrs)
  - Graphing and plotting for top release data totals and carcinogen totals in year range for NC(3-4 hrs)
  - Looked at various correlated feature analysis with respect to TRI - Zillow - ZIPCODE centroid data files.
    The variations of home prices and industry sectors within a specific range of radius from the centroid of the zip codes.
    Plotted various graphs for each analysis.
 - Analyzed data for 1-bedroom housing and TRI data for NC state through years 2002-2015
 - Worked on the distribution analysis of data from TRI and Zillow. 
 - Performed Correlation analysis of features from TRI and Zillow data combined together and observed patterns through years 2002-2015 for the NC state data 
 - Implemented Hypothesis testing with the Trial and Zillow data. The features of house pricing and distance of houses from the industries was tested in this 
   analysis. 
 - Observed the Linear Regression model for the TRI and Zillow data features to validate the null hypothesis formulated a s apart of the hypothesis testing.
